Virtual machines â the system will generate alerts just for Virtual machines<br/>3. All vSphere objects â the system will generate alerts for the all the objects coming from the vSphere solution.

defaultPolicyConfig.overcommit.question = Do you want to overcommit CPU and Memory in your environment?
defaultPolicyConfig.overcommit.questionDesc = Over committing allows you to consolidate more VMs and get more out of your resources
defaultPolicyConfig.overcommit.questionLongDesc = Memory overcommitment  - when the hypervisor enables competitive memory and CPU consolidation ratios. ESX allows users to power on virtual machines (VMs) with a total configured memory that exceeds the memory available on the physical machine. This is called memory overcommitment.<br/><br/>CPU overcommitment â running more vCPUs on a host than the total number of physical processor cores in that host.

defaultPolicyConfig.networkIO.question = Do you want to include Network and Storage I/O when analyzing capacity and workload?
defaultPolicyConfig.networkIO.questionDesc = Network and Storage I/O means what and why it should be used
defaultPolicyConfig.networkIO.questionLongDesc = Network and Storage workload data is based on the maximum observed throughput rather than the configured theoretical bandwidth. The data is relative to the maximum value that vRealize Operations detects after factoring in a fixed minimum value.<br/><br/>For example, you might attach a 1 gigabit network port to a 1 gigabit switch that passes traffic to a server over a 100 kilobyte WAN. In this situation, vRealize Operations cannot base the network I/O workload on the gigabit number and must estimate the capacity based on actual usage. vRealize Operations uses a form of queuing theory to determine the capacity of network I/O and disk I/O. The network I/O metric provides a sense of the network load relative to the historical usage. If a virtual machine sustains network traffic at the same rate, vRealize Operations might report the network workload at 100 percent because vRealize Operations does not yet detect a higher throughput. The statistics might be misleading because of this constant rate of traffic.
defaultPolicyConfig.networkIO.optionNoIO = Do not include Network I/O or Storage I/O
defaultPolicyConfig.networkIO.option1 = No I/O
defaultPolicyConfig.networkIO.optionNetwork =  Include only Network I/O and donât include Storage I/O
